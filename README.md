The kustomize-controller is a [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) component,
specialized in running continuous delivery pipelines for infrastructure and workloads
defined with Kubernetes manifests and assembled with Kustomize.

The cluster desired state is described through a Kubernetes Custom Resource named `Kustomization`.
Based on the creation, mutation or removal of a `Kustomization` resource in the cluster,
the controller performs actions to reconcile the cluster current state with the desired state.

## Features

* watches for `Kustomization` objects
* fetches artifacts produced by [source-controller](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller) from `Source` objects 
* watches `Source` objects for revision changes 
* generates the `kustomization.yaml` file if needed
* generates Kubernetes manifests with Kustomize SDK
* decrypts Kubernetes secrets with Mozilla SOPS and KMS
* validates the generated manifests with Kubernetes server-side apply dry-run
- detects drift between the desired and state and cluster state
- corrects drift by patching objects with Kubernetes server-side apply
* prunes the Kubernetes objects removed from source
* checks the health of the deployed workloads
* runs `Kustomizations` in a specific order, taking into account the depends-on relationship 
* notifies whenever a `Kustomization` status changes
